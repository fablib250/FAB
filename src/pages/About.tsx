                <h3 className="text-2xl font-rajdhani font-medium text-primary-300 mt-6 mb-4">Scientific Computing & AI</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
                  My interest in scientific computing has led me to explore various domains including numerical simulations, data analysis, and machine learning applications in physics. I'm particularly fascinated by how computational methods can help us understand complex physical systems and natural phenomena.
                </p>
                
                <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
                  In the realm of AI and IoT, I've developed projects that combine physical sensors with computational intelligence to create systems that can monitor, analyze, and respond to their environment. These technologies have immense potential to address pressing challenges in areas like climate monitoring, healthcare, and resource management.
